Lesson Plan

12 beginners (working in 6 pairs), two 3-hour sessions

Project Goal: Each student weaves an ~1" band on 28 tablets, starting with a diagonal stripe pattern. 
Bands can be used to make a pet collar, watch band, keychain, shoe straps, etc. 
Students can experiment with customization using Linda Hendrickson's pattern for Gill Sans lettering.

Session 1 (3 hours)

9:00 – 9:15 | Welcome & Introduction

Introductions 
Show finished examples and explain how a narrow band can become different projects.
Briefly explain warp-faced weaving and the unique role of tablets.

9:15 – 9:30 | Materials & Setup

Distribute kits: 28 tablets, board, warp spreader, shuttle, scissors.

Explain color selection: border, primary, contrast.
4 balls border color, 2 balls primary, 2 balls contrast. We will need to share/take turns. 

Pair up (1 = “thread wrangler,” 1 = “warper”).

9:30 – 10:30 | Demonstration: Continuous Speed Warp (Body + Borders Together)

Walk students through the full process:
Body (24 tablets):
All tablets facing the same way.
Thread holes A/B = primary, C/D = contrast.
Slipknot to clamp.
Drop tablets one by one while walking between clamps.
Confirm with partner: each thread goes through one card only.

Borders (4 tablets):
Thread all holes with border color.
Square knot to body warp (close to clamp).
Walk-drop until all four tablets are in place.
Confirm threads with partner again.

I will circulate to assist.

10:45 – 11:15 | Tablet Orientation 

Demonstrate how to:
Align all AB threads at the top, CD at the bottom.
Set cards in S threading (check in practice).
Place border tablets: 2 on each side, alternating S/Z.

Introduce the warp spreader (wood block):
Slide it between threads to space them evenly.
Use it to check tablet order, avoid crossed threads.

Students align their tablets and practice spreading their warps.

11:15 – 11:50 | Start Weaving

Demonstrate: throw shuttle, beat, maintain even edges.
Students begin weaving their diagonal stripe pattern.

11:50 – 12:00 | Wrap-Up & Homework

Quick group share of progress/ questions.
Homework: weave at least 6–8" of diagonal stripe. Try changing directions, try another option from KeithWeaves 
Encourage students to write down questions / sticking points 

Session 2 (3 hours)

9:00 – 9:20 | Warm-Up & Troubleshooting

Students share progress & challenges.
Demo fixes for: crossed threads, mis-turns, unweaving 

9:20 – 9:40 | Pattern Options

Show how Keithweaves patterns can be adapted to be twist-neutral.
Introduce Gill Sans lettering (note: not twist-neutral → shorter usable warp).
Students choose whether to continue stripes, try a new geometric pattern, or attempt lettering.

9:40 – 10:30 | Project Weaving
Students weave chosen design
I will circulate for 1:1 help.

10:45 – 11:30 | Weaving & Finishing Prep
Continue weaving toward project goal.
Demonstrate:
Allow 4" seam allowance at both ends.
Finishing methods: folding/sewing, braiding, attaching hardware (collar buckle, keyring, etc.).

11:30 – 11:50 | Begin Finishing
Students cut projects from clamps.
Start prepping ends depending on project choice.

11:50 – 12:00 | Closing Reflection
Share projects & experiences.
Discuss what felt intuitive, what was tricky - invite students to complete follow up survey via email 
Provide resource list: Linda Hendrickson, online pattern generators, tablet weaving communities.

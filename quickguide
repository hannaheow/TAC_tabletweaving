# **Tablet Weaving Quick Guide**

### **Materials (per student)**
* Tablets
* 4 ft board + 2 clamps
* Warp spreader (wood block)
* 4 balls border color, 2 balls primary, 2 balls contrast
* Shuttle
* Scissors
* Measuring tape

## **Step 1: Warp the Tablets (Body + Borders)**
**Body (24 tablets):**
1. Stack all 24 tablets **facing the same way (S threading)**.
2. Thread holes:
   * **A/B = Primary color**
   * **C/D = Contrast color**
     *(Diagram placeholder: tablet showing holes A–D, threads colored)*
3. Tie all 4 threads in a **slipknot** to the first clamp.
4. Walk to the other clamp, dropping **one tablet at a time**, looping threads around clamp, then return.
5. Repeat until all 24 tablets are dropped.

**Borders (4 tablets):**
1. Thread all holes = **Border color**.
2. Tie with a **square knot** to the body warp near clamp.
3. Walk-drop each tablet as above.
  
**Check:** Every thread passes through **exactly one tablet**.

## **Step 2: Orient the Tablets**
* **Body:** AB threads = top, CD = bottom. **S threading** → enter right, exit left.
* **Borders:** 2 on each side, alternate **S/Z threading**.

## **Step 3: Using the Warp Spreader**

* Place between warp threads to **evenly space tablets**.
* Keeps tablets turning smoothly.
* Optional: use as a **pattern tracker** when changing direction.

## **Step 4: Weaving**

* Weft color: **match border color**.
* Throw shuttle left → right, beat gently.
* Warp-faced: **pattern comes from warp threads**, not weft.

**Diagonal Stripe Pattern:**

* Turn all cards **forward** repeatedly.
* Reverse direction after several turns to change angle.

## **Tips & Reminders**
* Leave ≥4" at each end for **seam allowance**.
* ~12" of warp will **not be weavable**.
* Non-twist-neutral patterns (Gill Sans letters) → warp may shorten faster.

## **Finishing Ideas**

* Pet collar, watch band, keychain, shoe straps, or sample piece.
* Fold & sew, braid, or attach hardware.

---

## **Extensions** 
* Add vertical stripes (by changing the warp colors) 
* Try a pattern that is not speedwarped (ie more than two colors in a card) 
* Test different weights of warp and weft
